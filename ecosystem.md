The digital ecosystem of Wellness IP is broken down at a reasonably high level to cover the complexity of all areas. These are not meant to convey any timeline or priority, merely the details and considerations that typically need to be made regarding the digital property. 

The digital presence is broken down into six primary concerns: Design, Marketing, eCommerce, Native App, Web API, and Education. Each area is then outlined with important steps or details that are relevant to manifesting the product or presence.

## Design
The design effort focuses on establishing a foundation that informs our decisions when generating any item that has a visual component. This is essentially every single item from the product itself, packaging, user manuals, emails, websites, instagram posts, ads, etc.

Having a consistent and cohesive experience across all touch points of the product helps develop recognition and confidence in the brand.

1. Research
2. Branding
3. UI components
4. Voice and tone

## Native Mobile App
The mobile app will b the primary long term touch point for the majority of users, making it essential to deliver a delightful and intuitive experience that doesnâ€™t introduce a minimal amount of friction into the experience of using the product. Once developed, this is a property that needs to be maintained as new versions of OS come out, and as new bugs come up, additional features need to be integrated, and as scaling inevitably surfaces bottlenecks.

The mobile app will be the connection between the hardware itself and collecting data, as well as facilitating the various exercises needed to gather data. It will also be the primary presentation layer of data for users.

1. Choose engineering team
2. Establish product specs/expectations
3. Platform priority (iOS/Android)

13. Maintain/manage/bugs
14. App support
15. Authentication (Google, Facebook (ehhhh, not ideal), roll our own?)

## Web API
The Web API will serve as the backbone for collecting data and building out various features. It will need to concurrently soak up all data from connected devices while running various sets of business logic to derive personal and global insights.  It can also integrate with all of the various other services to ensure our data remains wholistic and centralized despite the numerous engagements points across multitudes of services.

It will serve an essential role in facilitating practitioners and how they engage with clients, developing trust and validation with clients, and with establishing us as the thought leaders at the forefront of the industry.

1. Platform to use - Vimeo, YouTube
2. Where content lives - marketing site, application etc
3. Content production
4. Content access
5. Progression and timelines
6. Taxonomies to relate to various exercises, users, uses

## Support
Ensuring customers who run into any form of hardship during the product lifecycle and engagement is essential to the health of the brand and thus the company. In this day and age, squeaky wheels have a megaphone and can turn all the other wheels away. This is a complex effort the needs to cover a multitude of need-states across various aspects of the product.

	3. User error
	4. Returns & warranties
2. App issues
